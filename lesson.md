## Brief

### Preparation

This lessons are 100% conceptual learning. Be prepared to lead learners into activities to continuously engage them for learning.

### Lesson Overview

Before this lesson, learners had hands on experience with containerization. In this lesson, learners will learn about what DevOps is and this learning will follow them throughout the module. After this lesson, all other lessons are very hands on and is lesser on conceptual learning.

## Part 1 - What is DevOps?

We will recap what DevOps is according to the reading material reference [link](https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/) by AWS.

### Definition

> DevOps is the combination of cultural philosophies, practices, and tools that increases an organizationâ€™s ability to deliver applications and services at high velocity: evolving and improving products at a faster pace than organizations using traditional software development and infrastructure management processes. This speed enables organizations to better serve their customers and compete more effectively in the market. - https://aws.amazon.com/devops/what-is-devops/

DevOps involves the organizational culture, practices and the relevant technological tools to achieve high application delivery velocity. The core of DevOps is the automation of Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment.

## Part 2 - Technological Tools

> This section helps learner to expose to technological tools that may not be used within this module.

DevOps requires the use of multiple technological tools to make automation possible. Each software has it's unique requirements and release strategies. Therefore, DevOps needs to garner the different technological tools to make automation possible.

### Activity - Research

Break into groups to research on what technologies or tool are being used by DevOps.

|# Name of Technology or Tool|How is it used?|

## Part 3 - Semantic Versioning

In the automated deployment process, known as Continuous Deployment, it needs to identify which image to pull from registry to deploy them. The unique identifier of the images are `tags`, which are typically version number. The most common versioning approach is `Semantic Versioning`. In short, [SemVer](https://semver.org/).

The versioning format is `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH` (example: `2.1.5`).

1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
1. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
1. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes

### *Activity - Research*

Break into groups, research on what the following pre-release labels means.

|Label|Meaning|
|-|-|
|Alpha| Input answer|
|Beta| Input answer|
|RC| Input answer|

### *Activity - Discuss*

Based on the given scenarios, discuss what should be the next version of the software.

**Scenario 1**

The current version is `2.1.3`. There is a new feature developed and two patches being fixed. There is no breaking change. What should be the next version?

**Scenario 2**

The current version is `2.1.3`. There is a breaking change that comes with three new features, and more than ten patches. What should be the next version?

**Scenario 3**

The current version is `2.1.3`. There are six new features. What should be the next version?

## Assignment

### Brief

When human intervention is involved in labaling the software version, it became complex and potentially ended up with differing opinions. Therefore, it is good to automate the Semantic Versioning number increment so that there will be no human emotions involve that leads to dispute. 

This tool, [@payfit/semantic-release](https://npm.io/package/@payfit/semantic-release) is a SemVer automation tool that determines the version of each releases and able to support the automatic tagging of container image tags. This tool relies on the Angular's Message Format to achieve the automation.

Research on what Angular Message Format is and document your findings after the line as you deem fit.
